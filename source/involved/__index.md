There are several ways to get involved with Events at Apache. Many of these opportunities fall under the umbrella of the Conferences Committee, while others are managed by different groups, such as the [Apache Community Development Project](https://community.apache.org/).

### Organizing Events

If you're an Apache Committer and interested in organizing an Apache Event, please refer to the [Organizing Events](/organize/index.html) section for guidance.

### Volunteering for Events

If you're keen on assisting with Apache Events, consider joining the appropriate [mailing list](mailing-lists.html) and volunteering for events. Opportunities range from project-specific events like Hackathons or Meetups to foundation-wide events like BarCamps or Retreats, as well as larger events such as Roadshows or Project/Project Cluster-related small conferences.

### Third Party Event Branding

For those interested in hosting an external event utilizing Apache Brands and Marks, review the [Third Party Event Branding Policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events.html) for information on the approval process and requirements.

### Speaking Opportunities

Explore the [Apache Speakers Resources](https://community.apache.org/speakers/index.html) maintained by the [Apache Community Development Project](https://community.apache.org/) if you're interested in speaking about Apache at external events.

### Finding Speakers

If you need speakers for your external event to discuss Apache Projects and Technologies, consult the [Apache Speakers Resources](https://community.apache.org/speakers/index.html) for guidance on finding speakers.

### Hosting Apache Tracks or BarCamps/Hackathons

For inquiries about hosting an Apache track or an Apache barcamp/hackathon-style event at your external event, please contact the [ConCom, the Conference Committee](https://www.apache.org/foundation/conferences.html) to discuss the possibilities.
