Community Over Code (formerly ApacheCon) is the official conference of the Apache Software Foundation. Its primary goals are education and community building. We strive to produce one conference each calendar year, typically held somewhere in North America and Europe, with plans to expand globally.

## What Is Community Over Code?

While Community Over Code events vary from year to year and location to location, there are some components that you can expect at every Community Over Code conference:

- **Technical Tracks**: Community Over Code features at least 4 tracks of technical content, often more.
- **Project Tracks**: Projects or groups of related projects may request a dedicated track, resembling a convention of ASF project conferences.
- **Hackathon Space**: Attendees can participate in hackathons to work on code or community issues.
- **State of the Foundation Keynote**: The President or other officer delivers an overview of the ASF's accomplishments.
- **PGP Key Signing**: A session for PGP key signing.
- **Duration**: The event typically spans 3 days or more.

Community Over Code draws an international audience of both speakers and attendees due to its status as the primary annual event for the continent in question.

### Planning Resources

Documentation for planning a Community Over Code conference can be found in the [ApacheCon Playbook](/about/commcode/playbook.html). Most planning tasks are undertaken by volunteers committed to assisting throughout the planning process for a specific conference.
