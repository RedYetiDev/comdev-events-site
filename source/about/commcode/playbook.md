This playbook is focused on ApacheCon or Roadshow volunteers who are actively involved in planning and running Apache events. Please be sure to bring your questions to the [planners@apachecon.com mailing list](mailto:planners@apachecon.com)!

# What to do before, during, and after an Apache event

This is a set of recommended actions that an event organizer may take before, during, and after ApacheCon.

Many of the recommendations in here can, of course, be applied to any Apache event or Roadshow, including third-party events, or project events run by PMCs.

If you follow these steps, you'll benefit from promotion within the larger Apache community. These suggestions are based on our experiences running ApacheCon.

This is a work in progress - please feel free to make suggestions!

## Before You Start

Review the [Event Branding Policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events) and secure permission for any events not produced directly by the ASF or its contracted producers. If you are an Apache PMC running your event, review the policy to ensure you're presenting the best face for ASF brands.

## Planning Topics To Cover

### Venue Requirements/Considerations

- Attempt to select a venue and date prior to the previous event, so that it can be announced from the stage a year in advance.
- BarCamp: Consider having an extra shoulder day before/after the event, with space for group discussions.
- Hackathon: Ensure a central space with power and network, and round tables for group collaboration.
- WiFi: Provide reliable 200+ Mb/s. ApacheCon attendees expect fast WiFi. Preferred info: 'apachecon'/'httpd1995'.
- Hard network drop in keynote room for streaming video. Hard network drop for reg desk.
- Room for media training: Consult with [ASF Marketing & Publicity](//www.apache.org/press/#contact).
- Board room for monthly board meeting (if the conference falls [during a board meeting](//www.apache.org/foundation/board/calendar)): Consult with secretary@apache.org.

### Communication

- Notify members@, commiters@, and all dev@ and users@ lists of an upcoming event. **Note special procedures** for committers@ and dev/users@ addresses.
- Notify all PMCs that there is space available for project summits. Work from scarcity rather than making this appear to be a free-for-all.

### Marketing Coordination

- Coordinate with M&P to create, publish, and update event-specific promotions on ASF social media channels.
- Establish a budget for a paid digital ad campaign for Roadshows three months before the event date.
- Coordinate with M&P to research spend options, negotiate rates, and secure media buy for digital advertising campaigns for Roadshows.
- Coordinate with M&P/Central Services to create artwork for online promotions and digital ad campaigns.

### CFP (Call for Papers)

- Ensure the CFP system is working before announcement.
- Promote the CFP across various channels and mailing lists.
- Schedule tweets for CFP deadlines and other important dates.

### Talk Selection

- Assemble a program committee and choose a program chair.
- Review talks within the timeline set by the producer.
- Prepare acceptance and fallback emails for speakers.

### Conference Schedule Announcement

- Announce the conference schedule across various channels and mailing lists.
- Prepare suggested tweets for all sessions.
- Update the speaker resources wiki page.

### Extra Events to be Scheduled

- Coordinate additional events like State Of The Feather, PGP Key Signing, BarCamp, and board meetings.

### In Months Before the Event

- Use Etherpads for planning purposes.
- Announce plans on blogs.apache.org and Twitter.
- Update sponsors and coordinate with them for promotions.
- Reach out to educational institutions and user groups for outreach.

## During

- Capture photos and videos, and promote them on social media.
- Conduct interviews with attendees and sponsors for promotional purposes.
- Introduce yourself and thank sponsors at every plenary session.
- Announce hashtags and encourage participation in social media activities.
- Announce the next year's event(s).

## After

- Share event photos and videos on social media, mentioning the next event.
- Thank sponsors and share any recordings from the event.
- Archive event information and update relevant websites.
